# Chip-8 Emulator
A messy Chip-8 emulator written in C with the SDL for graphics and inputs. Based on [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM).

The emulator configuration can be changed in `src/constant.h`.

This repo also contains some Chip-8 ROM. I didn't write any of them.
